# Automated Stock Market Analysis Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts for automated stock market analysis. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced trader, these scripts will help you analyze stock market data and make informed investment decisions.

## Contents

The repository includes the following scripts:

1. **data_collection.py**: This script allows for the collection of historical stock market data from various sources, such as Yahoo Finance and Alpha Vantage. It retrieves data for specified stocks and time periods and saves it in a CSV file for further analysis.

2. **data_preprocessing.py**: This script focuses on data preprocessing tasks, such as cleaning, feature engineering, and handling missing values. It ensures that the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

3. **technical_indicators.py**: This script calculates various technical indicators, such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and exponential moving averages (EMA). These indicators help in understanding the market trends and making predictions.

4. **pattern_recognition.py**: This script focuses on identifying chart patterns, such as head and shoulders, double tops/bottoms, and triangles. Recognizing these patterns can help in predicting future price movements.

5. **sentiment_analysis.py**: This script uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of news articles, social media posts, and financial reports related to specific stocks. Sentiment analysis provides insights into the market sentiment, which can impact stock prices.

6. **machine_learning_models.py**: This script provides a set of machine learning models, such as regression, classification, and time series forecasting. These models can be used to predict stock prices based on historical data and other relevant factors.

7. **portfolio_optimization.py**: This script focuses on optimizing a stock portfolio by calculating the optimal allocation of assets based on risk and return. It helps in building a diversified portfolio that maximizes returns while minimizing risk.

## Requirements

To run these scripts, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (for sentiment analysis)
- alpha_vantage (for accessing Alpha Vantage API)
- yfinance (for accessing Yahoo Finance data)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn nltk alpha_vantage yfinance
```

## Usage

Each script can be run independently by executing the corresponding Python file. You can pass command-line arguments or modify the script to customize the analysis for your specific needs. Make sure to update the API keys and access credentials in the scripts wherever necessary.

For detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the individual script files.
